# Zeller Coding Challenge - Frontend

This is a pure frontend application built with React and Styled Components, designed to display and filter customer data, showcasing best practices in performance, responsiveness, and code quality.

## 1. Local Environment Setup

This project uses NVM (Node Version Manager) to enforce a specific Node.js version, ensuring environment consistency across all developer machines.

### 1.1 Node.js Version

Before installing dependencies, please ensure you have NVM installed and running.

Run the following command in the project root directory to automatically switch to the required Node.js version:

```
nvm use
```

Required Version: 24.11.1

### 1.2 API Key Configuration (Mandatory)

The application requires an API key for data fetching. You must configure this key in a local environment file.

1. In the project root directory (alongside package.json), create a new file named: `.env.local`

2. Reference the structure of the provided `.env.example` file and add your unique API key:

```
# Content of .env.local
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_FROM_EMAIL_HERE
```

Replace YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_FROM_EMAIL_HERE with the actual value shared via email.

## 2. Running the Project

### 2.1 Install Dependencies

After confirming the correct Node version, install project dependencies: 
```
npm install
```

### 2.2 Start the Development Server

Start the local development server:

```
npm start
```

The application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


### 2.3 Test the App: 

After install the dependencies, run command:
```
npm run test
```
to run all the unit tests

and the test coverage report could be generated by running:
```
npm run test:coverage
```
